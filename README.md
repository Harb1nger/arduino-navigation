# Arduino Navigation Project

## Purpose

The program is to calculate the date required to successfully navigate a route. In this case a direct heading to a destination with a noted waypoint (landmark) on route. Look up any terms you are unfamiliar with on relevant navigation terminology and formulae sources.

## Brief

The user should be asked to enter the following information: True track (deg); Variation (deg); Deviation (deg); True Air Speed (Knots); Distance to destination (Nautical Miles) and Distance to waypoint (Nautical Miles). All input data should be checked that it is within range (e.g. Distance is a positive non-zero value). An error/warning should be displayed where incorrect date is entered and the user should be re-prompted to enter the correct information.

You should then use this information to calculate: Magnetic track (deg); Compass heading (deg); Flight time to destination (time); Fuel Burn (assume 45 litres/hour) and Flight time to landmark (time)
